### Doc folder

The doc directory contains the report or presentation files. It can have subfolders. 

+ *main.ipynb*: The final Python codes for the submission.
+ *main.pdf*: The final report for submission.
+ *main.Rmd*: The R codes created to cross-validate all the work done in Python. We created the entire project in R so that the teaching staff in ADS can reuse it for future semesters.
+ *main.html*: The report generated for the codes in R.
